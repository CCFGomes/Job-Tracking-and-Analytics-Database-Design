# Job Tracking and Analytics Database Design

Welcome to the Job Tracking and Analytics Database Design project. This repository contains the meticulously crafted data model and database schema for a comprehensive Job Tracking and Analytics Platform.

## Overview

In this project, we design a robust database schema to handle job-related information, including companies, jobs, skills, tools, job requirements, users, job applications, salaries, and labor market analytics. The design encompasses both the conceptual data model and the physical database schema, ensuring efficiency and organization.

## Key Components

- **Data Model:** A structured representation of data entities and their relationships.
- **Database Schema:** The organized arrangement of tables, fields, and relationships.
- **Design:** Thoughtful consideration of skills, tools, job requirements, and user information.
- **Schema Modeling:** Detailed modeling of companies, jobs, skills, tools, and more.
- **Stored Procedures:** Critical functionalities encapsulated for enhanced database management.
- **Triggers:** Intelligent automation for real-time updates of labor market statistics.
